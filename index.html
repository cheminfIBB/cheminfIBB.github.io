<h1><u>Department of Bioinformatics</u></h1>
<h4>Bio- and cheminformatics core facility @ IBB PAS</h4>

The main interests of our group revolves around modulating cellular processes with novel tool compounds, peptidomimetics and miRNA.
We also study cellular processes from population genetics, systems biology and systems medicine perspective.
<p>
<p>Over the years we have developed our own algorithms and unique methodologies for machine learning,
data mining and mathematical modeling (see <a href="software.html"> Software section</a>).
We are also involved in European infrastructure projects, providing efficient computing infrastructure,
databases and services to the academic and industrial communities. (see <a href="services.html"> Services section</a>)

<p>Our successes include the world's first non-nucleoside inhibitor of the DNA methylation process
(compound RG108, currently sold by all major chemical companies) and small molecular weight compounds designed as
CFTR modulators (USPTO Application # 20160113896).

<p>Department of Bioinformatics is a core facility providing computational infrastructure and expertise for IBB PAS.<p>
